Bitwise Operator

& (Bitwise AND) - Performs a binary AND operation on each bit of the operands.
Eg. 5 & 3 = 1  
    101 
  & 011
   ------
    001

| (Bitwise OR) - Performs a binary OR operation on each bit of the operands.
Eg. 5 | 3 = 7
    101
  | 011
  ------
    111

~ (Bitwise NOT) - Performs a binary NOT operation on each bit of the operand.
Eg. ~5 = 101 = 010 = 2

<< (Left Shift) - Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of
positions specified by the right operand.
Eg. 5 << 1 = 0101 = 1010
            0110   = 1100

>> (Right Shift) - Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of
positions specified by the right operand.
Eg. 5 >> 1 = 0101 = 0010
